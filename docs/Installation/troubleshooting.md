Tue 14 19:18:01 e/Jumpscale/me/Me.py - 461 - tfgrid_phonebook_register          : EXCEPTION: 
    signature verification failed, ensure your pubkey to be the same as local configured nacl
--TRACEBACK------------------

```

is most likely caused that you registered on phonebook with different words other than the ones in the 3bot connect app

## case you have an old container with your old key and secret
you can get your private key `cat /sandbox/cfg/keys/default/key.priv`
and the secret `cat /sandbox/cfg/jumpscale_config.toml | grep SECRET`


#### Recovering old words (saved)
if you have your key.priv and secret from jumpscale_config and want to restore them



##### Restore estore the key
either copy the file back into `/sandbox/cfg/keys/default/key.priv` or

```
root@3bot:/sandbox# echo -n 'PRIVATEKEYCONTENT' > /sandbox/cfg/keys/default/key.priv
root@3bot:/sandbox# cat /sandbox/cfg/keys/default/key.priv | wc -c
144
```

make sure the length is 144

##### Restore the secret

edit `/sandbox/cfg/jumpscale_config.toml` and set `SECRET` to the old secret.

when done do `jsx check`
##### Retrieve the words 

execute that in kosmos `j.data.nacl.default.words`

NOTE: these words aren't compatible with the keys you have in 3bot connect 

NOTE: You may have to delete `/sandbox/cfg/bcdb_config` and `pkill redis` if you got secret conflicts
