## threebotbuilder

`threebotbuilder` can be used to build and push all our 3bot images.

  We have four images:
- threefoldtech/base: pass `-b` to build it
- threefoldtech/3botdev: built by default
- threefoldtech/3bot: built by default
- threefoldtech/3bot-production: pass `-t` to build it

  to push all images, pass `-p` to the command

```bash
jsx threebotbuilder --help
Usage: jsx.py threebotbuilder [OPTIONS]

  create the 3bot and 3botdev images

Options:
  -p, --push        push to docker hub
  -b, --base        build base image as well
  -t, --production  build production image as well
  -c, --cont        don't delete continue a previously stopped run
  --help            Show this message and exit.

```
## wireguard

**This command will**
* Configure ```wireguard``` on the ```Host``` machine.
* Install and configure the wireguard on all the running containers.
* Add the running containers as peers in the ```wireguard``` configuration on the ```Host``` machine.
* Create a ```wireguard``` network between the ``Host`` machine and the running containers.

**Notes**
* If you want to allow the running containers to ```ping``` each other **i.e** to send data to each other on the ```wireguard``` network, you will have to allow the traffic on the ```Host``` machine.
This can be done with this command
```bash
sudo sysctl -w net.inet.ip.forwarding=1
```

* ```wireguard``` command must be run as ```sudo``` to allow thre required privileges.

* You must install ```wireguard``` [from here](https://www.wireguard.com/install/) on the ```Host``` machine before running `jsx wireguard`.



## other commands

use the built in help e.g. ```jsx install --help```
