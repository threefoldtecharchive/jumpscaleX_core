# Initialize 3bot environment with identity

## For the first start of jsx container

- Start kosmos shell using `jsx kosmos -n <YOUR-THREEBOT-NAME>`

Example: `jsx kosmos -n hamada.3bot`

- After kosmos starts make configure to j.me
    ```python
    j.me.configure()
    ```

This will as you about your information, 3botname, email, description .. and if you want to add admins to your system

- Then register to the tf_phonebook using
    ```python
    j.me.tfgrid_phonebook_register()
    ```

#### Congratulations your 3bot is ready now you can start the 3bot server and start your reservation.

## To save your identity you can copy these files to safe place

These contains the identity information, please keep them safe

 ![recover photo](./images/identity2.png)

- `default` file contains the name default identity, please make it to refer to your recovered identity

Example:

```
3BOTDEVEL:3bot:identities: cat default 
walid.3bot
```
 
## Creating multiple identities:
You can either start kosmos with a new identity name ```jsx kosmos -n newname.3bot``` which will guide you through configuration, or you can do it from kosmos shell as follows:
```bash
JSX> j.myidentities.get("test2.3bot")
 - save identity:test1.3bot

## jumpscale.threebot.me
ID: 3
 - name                : test2.3bot
 - tid                 : 0
 - tname               :
 - email               :
 - signing_key         :
 - verify_key          :
 - admins              : []
 - sshkey_name         :
 - sshkey_pub          :
 - sshkey_priv         :


JSX> i = j.myidentities.get("test2.3bot")
```
- Then configure your new identity
```
JSX> i.configure()

- Then register to the tf_phonebook using
```python
i.tfgrid_phonebook_register()
```

- Then start 3bot server with your preferred identity using
```python
JSX> j.servers.threebot.start(background=True, identity="test2.3bot")
```

- You will find your identity set in 3bot server

## Recovering identites

In case you lost your identites, we can restore from the saved toml keys in `/sandbox/myhost/identities`.

These contains the identity information, please keep them safe

 ![recover photo](./images/identity2.png)

- `default` file contains the name default identity, please make it to refer to your recovered identity

Example:

```
